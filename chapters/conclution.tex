Visualizations can be static or dynamic. Interactive visualizations often lead to discovery and do a better job than static data tools. Interactive visualizations can help gain great insight from big data. Interactive brushing and linking between visualization approaches and networks or Web-based tools can facilitate the scientific process. Web- based visualization helps get dynamic data timely and keep visualizations up to date.

The extension of some conventional visualization
approaches to handling big data is far from enough in
functions. More new methods and tools of Big Data
visualization should be developed for different Big Data
applications. Advances of Big Data visualization are
presented and a SWOT analysis of current visualization
software tools for big data visualization has been
conducted in this paper. This will help develop new
methods and tools for big data visualization. Big Data
analytics and visualization can be integrated tightly to
work best for Big Data applications. Immersive virtual
reality (VR) is a new and powerful method in handling
high dimensionality and abstraction. It will facilitate Big
Data visualization greatly.
