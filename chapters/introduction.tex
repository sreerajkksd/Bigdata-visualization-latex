\section{The Rise Of Data Visualization}
Data illustration techniques have been in use since as early as 6200 BC, when the oldest known map was drawn. However, it was not until the eighteenth century when data visualizations went beyond mapping and more abstract measures were introduced, including the ever-popular pie and bar charts.The nineteenth century saw the creation of what many have argued to be the world’s best data visualization: Charles Joseph Minard’s 1869 visualization titled Napoleon’s March, which depicts the movement and losses of Napoleon’s army as it invaded Russia in 1812.After 1975, we witnessed the most rapid advancements in data visualization, which stemmed from the development of software and computer systems.\par 
Data visualizations moved beyond pie and bar charts, and more complex formats began to appear and aid us in processing information. For example, through the use of mind maps, our thought patterns can now be visually organized. Apps like Flipboard and Newsmap have completely reinvented the display of news, while tag clouds have provided another way to discover and search for information. And through network graphs, we can now uncover the connectivity between any number of entities, be they our own social circles, groups of companies or globally dispersed cities.
